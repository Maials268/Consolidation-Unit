        <p>Hi, my name is Christianna! I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design. I am also on track to get a minor in computer science as well. Through Pitt, I am a member of the Delta Zeta sorority, a member of the Women in Computer Science Club, and a player on the club lacrosse team. Being a part of these organizations has allowed me to meet so many new people, which I love, but more importantly, it has given me the chance to take part in different community service opportunities. In fact, I went to PDM for all 12 hours and had a blast!</p>
